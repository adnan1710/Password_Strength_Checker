Password Strength Checker with Machine Learning

A password strength checker works by understanding the combination of digits, letters, and special symbols used in a password.
In this project [Password Strength Classifier Dataset]<https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhavikbb/password-strength-classifier-dataset> was used to train and test the model. We used Random Forest Classifier on the dataset as it is a powerful and flexible machine learning algorithm that can handle large datasets and high-dimensional feature spaces. There is less chance of overfitting it does not require any assumptions about the distribution of the data.
